SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS 

Cell culture and transfection 

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line 293FT (Life Technologies) was maintained in 
DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(HyClone), 2mM GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 100U/mL penicillin, and 100.g/mL 
streptomycin at 37¡C with 5% CO2 incubation. 

293FT cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, 24-well plates, or 96-well plates (Corning) 
24 hours prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life 
Technologies) at 80-90% confluency following the manufacturerÕs recommended protocol. For 
each well of a 6-well plate, a total of 1 ug of Cas9+sgRNA plasmid was used. For each well of a 
24-well plate, a total of 500ng Cas9+sgRNA plasmid was used unless otherwise indicated. For 
each well of a 96-well plate, 65 ng of Cas9 plasmid was used at a 1:1 molar ratio to the U6sgRNA 
PCR product. 

Human embryonic stem cell line HUES9 (Harvard Stem Cell Institute core) was 
maintained in feeder-free conditions on GelTrex (Life Technologies) in mTesR medium 
(Stemcell Technologies) supplemented with 100ug/ml Normocin (InvivoGen). HUES9 cells 
were transfected with Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 4-D Nucleofector Kit (Lonza) following the 
manufacturerÕs protocol. 

SURVEYOR nuclease assay for genome modification 

293FT and HUES9 cells were transfected with DNA as described above. Cells were 
incubated at 37¼C for 72 hours post-transfection prior to genomic DNA extraction. Genomic 
DNA was extracted using the QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicentre) following the 
manufacturerÕs protocol. Briefly, pelleted cells were resuspended in QuickExtract solution and 
incubated at 65¼C for 15 minutes, 68¡C for 15 minutes, and 98¼C for 10 minutes. 

The genomic region flanking the CRISPR target site for each gene was PCR amplified 
(primers listed in Supplementary Table 2), and products were purified using QiaQuick Spin 
Column (Qiagen) following the manufacturerÕs protocol. 400ng total of the purified PCR 
products were mixed with 2l 10X Taq DNA Polymerase PCR buffer (Enzymatics) and 
ultrapure water to a final volume of 20l, and subjected to a re-annealing process to enable 
heteroduplex formation: 95¼C for 10min, 95¼C to 85¼C ramping at Ð 2¼C/s, 85¼C to 25¼C at Ð 


Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.2647

0.25¼C/s, and 25¼C hold for 1 minute. After re-annealing, products were treated with 
SURVEYOR nuclease and SURVEYOR enhancer S (Transgenomics) following the 
manufacturerÕs recommended protocol, and analyzed on 4-20% Novex TBE poly-acrylamide 
gels (Life Technologies). Gels were stained with SYBR Gold DNA stain (Life Technologies) for 
30 minutes and imaged with a Gel Doc gel imaging system (Bio-rad). Quantification was based 
on relative band intensities. Indel percentage was determined by the formula, 100 x (1 - (1 - (b + 
c) / (a + b + c))1/2), where a is the integrated intensity of the undigested PCR product, and b and 
c are the integrated intensities of each cleavage product. 

Northern blot analysis of tracrRNA expression in human cells 

Northern blots were performed as previously described1. Briefly, RNAs were extracted 
using the mirPremier microRNA Isolation Kit (Sigma) and heated to 95¼C for 5 min before 
loading on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (SequaGel, National Diagnostics). Afterwards, 
RNA was transferred to a pre-hybridized Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and 
crosslinked with Stratagene UV Crosslinker (Stratagene). Probes were labeled with [gamma32P] 
ATP (Perkin Elmer) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). After washing, 
membrane was exposed to phosphor screen for one hour and scanned with phosphorimager 
(Typhoon). 

Bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation status 

Genomic DNA from 293FT cells was isolated with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit 
(Qiagen) and bisulfite converted with EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning Kit (Zymo Research). 
Bisulfite PCR was conducted using KAPA2G Robust HotStart DNA Polymerase (KAPA 
Biosystems) with primers designed using the Bisulfite Primer Seeker (Zymo Research, 
Supplementary Table 2). Resulting PCR amplicons were gel-purified, digested with EcoRI and 
HindIII, and ligated into a pUC19 backbone prior to transformation. Individual clones were then 
Sanger sequenced to assess DNA methylation status. 

Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.2647

In vitro transcription and cleavage assay 

Whole cell lysates from 293FT cells were prepared with lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 
100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). T7-driven sgRNA was transcribed in vitro using custom 
oligos (Supplementary Sequences) and HiScribe T7 In Vitro Transcription Kit (NEB), following 
the manufacturerÕs recommended protocol. To prepare methylated target sites, pUC19 plasmid 
was methylated by M.SssI and tested by digestion with HpaII. Unmethylated and successfully 
methylated pUC19 plasmids were linearized by NheI. The in vitro cleavage assay was performed 
as follows: for a 20 uL cleavage reaction, 10 uL of cell lysate was incubated with 2 uL cleavage 
buffer (100 mM HEPES, 500 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 25% glycerol), 1 ug in vitro 
transcribed RNA, and 300 ng pUC19 plasmid DNA. 

Deep sequencing to assess targeting specificity 

HEK 293FT cells plated in 96-well plates were transfected with Cas9 plasmid DNA and 
single guide RNA (sgRNA) PCR cassette 72 hours prior to genomic DNA extraction 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). The genomic region flanking the CRISPR target site for each gene was 
amplified (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Sequences) by a fusion 
PCR method to attach the Illumina P5 adapters as well as unique sample-specific barcodes to the 
target amplicons (schematic described in Supplementary Figure 5). PCR products were purified 
using EconoSpin 96-well Filter Plates (Epoch Life Sciences) following the manufacturerÕs 
recommended protocol. 

Barcoded and purified DNA samples were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA 
Assay Kit or Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and pooled in an equimolar ratio. 
Sequencing libraries were then sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq Personal Sequencer (Life 
Technologies). 

Sequencing data analysis and indel detection 

MiSeq reads were filtered by requiring an average Phred quality (Q score) of at least 23, 
as well as perfect sequence matches to barcodes and amplicon forward primers. Reads from on- 
and off-target loci were analyzed by first performing Smith-Waterman alignments against 
amplicon sequences that included 50 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the target site (a 

Nature Biotechnology: doi:10.1038/nbt.2647

total of 120 bp). Alignments, meanwhile, were analyzed for indels from 5 nucleotides upstream 
to 5 nucleotides downstream of the target site (a total of 30 bp). Analyzed target regions were 
discarded if part of their alignment fell outside the MiSeq read itself, or if matched base-pairs 
comprised less than 85% of their total length. 

Negative controls for each sample provided a gauge for the inclusion or exclusion of 
indels as putative cutting events. For each sample, an indel was counted only if its quality score 
exceeded ......, where .. was the mean quality-score of the negative control corresponding to 
that sample and .. was the standard deviation of the same. This yielded whole target-region indel 
rates for both negative controls and their corresponding samples. Using the negative controlÕs 

, and its read-count.., the sampleÕs observed indel count ..per-target-region-per-read error rate, 
, a maximum-likelihood estimate for the fraction of reads having target-regions with true-..

set to 1.96, meaning a confidence of 95%. The maximum upper bounds and minimum lower 
bounds for each biological replicate are listed in Supplementary Tables 5-8. 

qRT-PCR analysis of relative Cas9 and sgRNA expression 

72 hours post-transfection, total RNA from 293FT cells was harvested with miRNeasy 
Micro Kit (Qiagen). Reverse-strand synthesis for sgRNAs was performed with qScript Flex 
cDNA kit (VWR) and custom first-strand synthesis primers (Supplementary Table 2). qPCR 
analysis was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Life Technologies) and custom 
primers (Supplementary Table 2), using GAPDH as an endogenous control. Relative 
quantification was calculated by the ..CT method.
